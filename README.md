# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Repo for Course Project on Coursera

The repo contains run_analysis.R file for creating tidy data set from the data 
available on https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .
The data should be first extracted and the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" should be put in the same directory as the
run_analysis.R file.

The run_analysis.R file can be run as any R script e.g. from the RStudio.
The result of running run_analysis.R file is the output: tidy data set of merged train and test sets saved as 
tidy_data_set.txt in folder "UCI HAR Dataset".
